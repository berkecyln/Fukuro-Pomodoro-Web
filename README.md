# Fukuro

I built Fukuro (means "owl" in Japanese) because I was looking for a straightforward Pomodoro timer that just runs. My main goal was to create a minimalist tool where I could press 'start' once and have it automatically cycle through all my work sessions and breaks without needing to click anything else. I wanted to stay in the flow, not manage a timer.

This app is the result of that idea. It's a simple, clean timer designed to be set up once and then left alone to guide your focus.

### What it Does ?
**Continuous Flow:** This is the core idea. Once you start the timer, it will automatically transition from work to break and back to work again until your planned sessions are finished.

**Customizable Timers:** You can set the duration for your focus sessions and breaks, as well as the total number of sessions in your cycle.

**Background Sounds:** I added a few simple ambient sounds (like rain and a fireplace) that you can play during sessions or breaks to help block out distractions.

**Session Progress:** A simple progress bar is shown for each session. This allows you to see your progress in two ways: horizontally as you complete the current session, and vertically as you advance through the entire list of sessions.

**Simple Todo List:** There's a basic checklist on the side if you want to jot down a few tasks for your focus block.

### Design Philosophy
The design is meant to be minimal and distraction-free. The interface only shows what's necessary, using a calm color scheme to help you focus on your work, not on the timer itself.
